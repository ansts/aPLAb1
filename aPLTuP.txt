Sometimes, secondary antibodies are used to immobilize the antibody target, <i>e.g.</i> goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-human IgM. Sometimes the target might be contaminated with unrelated antibodies, for example bovine IgG, rabbit IgG and murine IgM. Sometimes, the target itself might be serum with auto-antibodies such as human IgG auto-anti IgE.
TPPSSLH	S-S-[IL]	Confirmed or suspected binder to immunoglobulin Fc Region. If your target is antibody with Fc Region, Pay attention!
TPSSIMS	S-S-[IL]	Confirmed or suspected binder to immunoglobulin Fc Region. If your target is antibody with Fc Region, Pay attention!
TPSSLSN	S-S-[IL]	Confirmed or suspected binder to immunoglobulin Fc Region. If your target is antibody with Fc Region, Pay attention!
VWMPWFP	W-x(2)-W	Confirmed or suspected plastic binder. Blocking steps do not necessarily eliminate all plastic binders. Pay attention!
WSHPQDL	H-P-[QM]	Confirmed or suspected streptavidin binder. Streptavidin is often used to capture biotinylated targets on solid surface.
HHPMLLL	H-P-[QM]	Confirmed or suspected streptavidin binder. Streptavidin is often used to capture biotinylated targets on solid surface.
